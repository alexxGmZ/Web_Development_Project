(They are not all exactly one sentence, but they are very short.)\r\n\r\nNone of these stories are mine. They were sent to me by readers of Atomic Habits. My hope is that these examples will illustrate how real people are putting the book into practice. They will show you what people are actually doing to build good habits and break bad ones. And hopefully, they will spark some ideas for how you can do the same.\r\n\r\nI have divided the stories into categories that roughly correspond to different sections or ideas in the book.\r\n', 'James Clear', 'thumbnail_1652675803.png', 'Technology', '2022-05-11'),
('7 Ways to Retain More of Every Book You Read', 'There are many benefits to reading more books, but perhaps my favorite is this: A good book can give you a new way to interpret your past experiences.\r\n\r\nWhenever you learn a new mental model or idea, it\'s like the “software” in your brain gets updated. Suddenly, you can run all of your old data points through a new program. You can learn new lessons from old moments. As Patrick O\'Shaughnessy says, “Reading changes the past.”\r\n\r\nOf course, this is only true if you internalize and remember insights from the books you read. Knowledge will only compound if it is retained. In other words, what matters is not simply reading more books, but getting more out of each book you read.\r\n\r\nGaining knowledge is not the only reason to read, of course. Reading for pleasure or entertainment can be a wonderful use of time, but this article is about reading to learn. With that in mind, I\'d like to share some of the best reading comprehension strategies I’ve found.\r\n1. Quit More Books\r\nIt doesn\'t take long to figure out if something is worth reading. Skilled writing and high-quality ideas stick out.\r\n\r\nAs a result, most people should probably start more books than they do. This doesn\'t mean you need to read each book page-by-page. You can skim the table of contents, chapter titles, and subheadings. Pick an interesting section and dive in for a few pages. Maybe flip through the book and glance at any bolded points or tables. In ten minutes, you\'ll have a reasonable idea of how good it is.\r\n\r\nThen comes the crucial step: Quit books quickly and without guilt or shame.\r\n\r\nLife is too short to waste it on average books. The opportunity cost is too high. There are so many amazing things to read. I think Patrick Collison, the founder of Stripe, put it nicely when he said, “Life is too short to not read the very best book you know of right now.”\r\n\r\nHere\'s my recommendation:\r\n\r\nStart more books. Quit most of them. Read the great ones twice.\r\n\r\n2. Choose Books You Can Use Instantly\r\nOne way to improve reading comprehension is to choose books you can immediately apply. Putting the ideas you read into action is one of the best ways to secure them in your mind. Practice is a very effective form of learning.\r\n\r\nChoosing a book that you can use also provides a strong incentive to pay attention and remember the material. That’s particularly true when something important hangs in the balance. If you’re starting a business, for example, then you have a lot of motivation to get everything you can out of the sales book you’re reading. Similarly, someone who works in biology might read The Origin of Species more carefully than a random reader because it connects directly to their daily work.\r\n\r\nOf course, not every book is a practical, how-to guide that you can apply immediately, and that\'s fine. You can find wisdom in many different books. But I do find that I\'m more likely to remember books that are relevant to my daily life.\r\n\r\n3. Create Searchable Notes\r\nKeep notes on what you read. You can do this however you like. It doesn\'t need to be a big production or a complicated system. Just do something to emphasize the important points and passages.\r\n\r\nI do this in different ways depending on the format I\'m consuming. I highlight passages when reading on Kindle. I type out interesting quotes as I listen to audiobooks. I dog-ear pages and transcribe notes when reading a print book.\r\n\r\nBut here\'s the real key: store your notes in a searchable format.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to leave the task of reading comprehension solely up to your memory. I keep my notes in Evernote. I prefer Evernote over other options because 1) it is instantly searchable, 2) it is easy to use across multiple devices, and 3) you can create and save notes even when you\'re not connected to the internet.\r\n\r\nI get my notes into Evernote in three ways:\r\n\r\nI. Audiobook: I create a new Evernote file for each book and then type my notes directly into that file as I listen.\r\n\r\nII. Ebook: I highlight passages on my Kindle Paperwhite and use a program called Clippings to export all of my Kindle highlights directly into Evernote. Then, I add a summary of the book and any additional thoughts before posting it to my book summaries page.\r\n\r\nIII. Print: Similar to my audiobook strategy, I type my notes as I read. If I come across a longer passage I want to transcribe, I place the book on a book stand as I type. (Typing notes while reading a print book can be annoying because you are always putting the book down and picking it back up, but this is the best solution I\'ve found.)\r\n\r\nOf course, your notes don\'t have to be digital to be “searchable.” For example, you can use Post-It Notes to tag certain pages for future reference. As another option, Ryan Holiday suggests storing each note on an index card and categorizing them by the topic or book.\r\n\r\nThe core idea is the same: Keeping searchable notes is essential for returning to ideas easily. An idea is only useful if you can find it when you need it.\r\n\r\n4. Combine Knowledge Trees\r\nOne way to imagine a book is like a knowledge tree with a few fundamental concepts forming the trunk and the details forming the branches. You can learn more and improve reading comprehension by “linking branches” and integrating your current book with other knowledge trees.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nWhile reading The Tell-Tale Brain by neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran, I discovered that one of his key points connected to a previous idea I learned from social work researcher Brené Brown.\r\nIn my notes for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, I noted how Mark Manson\'s idea of “killing yourself” overlaps with Paul Graham\'s essay on keeping your identity small.\r\nAs I read Mastery by George Leonard, I realized that while this book was about the process of improvement, it also shed some light on the connection between genetics and performance.\r\nI added each insight to my notes for that particular book.\r\n\r\nConnections like these help you remember what you read by “hooking” new information onto concepts and ideas you already understand. As Charlie Munger says, “If you get into the mental habit of relating what you’re reading to the basic structure of the underlying ideas being demonstrated, you gradually accumulate some wisdom.”\r\n\r\nWhen you read something that reminds you of another topic or immediately sparks a connection or idea, don’t allow that thought to come and go without notice. Write about what you’ve learned and how it connects to other ideas.\r\n\r\n5. Write a Short Summary\r\nAs soon as I finish a book, I challenge myself to summarize the entire text in just three sentences. This constraint is just a game, of course, but it forces me to consider what was really important about the book.\r\n\r\nSome questions I consider when summarizing a book include:\r\n\r\nWhat are the main ideas?\r\nIf I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?\r\nHow would I describe the book to a friend?\r\nIn many cases, I find that I can usually get just as much useful information from reading my one-paragraph summary and reviewing my notes as I would if I read the entire book again.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like you can’t squeeze the whole book into three sentences, consider using the Feynman Technique.', 'Pedro Penduko', 'thumbnail_1652707391.png', 'Military', '2022-05-31'),
('Absolute Success is Luck. Relative Success is Hard Work.', 'In 1997, Warren Buffett, the famous investor and multi-billionaire, proposed a thought experiment.\r\n\r\n“Imagine that it is 24 hours before you are going to be born,” he said, “and a genie comes to you.”\r\n\r\n“The genie says you can determine the rules of the society you are about to enter and you can design anything you want. You get to design the social rules, the economic rules, the governmental rules. And those rules are going to prevail for your lifetime and your children\'s lifetime and your grandchildren\'s lifetime.”\r\n\r\n“But there is a catch,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You don\'t know whether you\'re going to be born rich or poor, male or female, infirm or able-bodied, in the United States or Afghanistan. All you know is that you get to take one ball out of a barrel with 5.8 billion balls in it. And that\'s you.”\r\n\r\n“In other words,” Buffett continues, “you\'re going to participate in what I call the Ovarian Lottery. And that is the most important thing that\'s ever going to happen to you in your life. It\'s going to determine way more than what school you go to, how hard you work, all kinds of things.”\r\n\r\nBuffett has long been a proponent for the role of luck in success. In his 2014 Annual Letter, he wrote, “Through dumb luck, [my business partner] Charlie and I were born in the United States, and we are forever grateful for the staggering advantages this accident of birth has given us.”\r\n\r\nWhen explained in this way, it seems hard to deny the importance of luck, randomness, and good fortune in life. And indeed, these factors play a critical role. But let\'s consider a second story.\r\n', 'Lastikman', 'thumbnail_1652711306.png', 'Medicine', '2022-05-17'),
('How Innovative Ideas Arise', 'In 2010, Thomas Thwaites decided he wanted to build a toaster from scratch. He walked into a shop, purchased the cheapest toaster he could find, and promptly went home and broke it down piece by piece.\r\n\r\nThwaites had assumed the toaster would be a relatively simple machine. By the time he was finished deconstructing it, however, there were more than 400 components laid out on his floor. The toaster contained over 100 different materials with three of the primary ones being plastic, nickel, and steel.\r\n\r\nHe decided to create the steel components first. After discovering that iron ore was required to make steel, Thwaites called up an iron mine in his region and asked if they would let him use some for the project.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, they agreed.', 'James Clear', 'thumbnail_1652676046.png', 'Real Estate', '2022-05-27'),

('The Ultimate Habit Tracker Guide: Why and How to Track Your Habits', 'If you want to stick with a habit for good, one simple and effective thing you can do is keep a habit tracker.\r\n\r\nHere\'s why:\r\n\r\nElite performers will often measure, quantify, and track their progress in various ways. Each little measurement provides feedback. It offers a signal of whether they are making progress or need to change course.\r\n\r\nGabrielle Hamilton, a chef in New York City, provides a good example. During an interview with the New York Times, she said, “The one thing I see that consistently separates the chef from the home cook is that we taste everything, all the time, before we commit it to the dish, right down to the grains of salt. We slurp shot glasses of olive oil and aerate them in our mouths as if it were a wine we were trying to know. We taste the lamb, the fish, the butter, the milk before we use it… we chew salt to see how we like it in our teeth, on our tongues, and to know its flavor, its salinity.”\r\n\r\nFor the chef, tasting the ingredients tells them whether they are making progress toward their desired end goal. It provides the immediate feedback they need to get the recipe just right.\r\n\r\nLike a chef improving a recipe through trial and error, we often improve our habits through trial and error. If one approach doesn\'t deliver the desired effect, then we adjust—like a chef tweaking the amount of an ingredient.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an important difference between getting feedback while cooking a meal and getting feedback while building a habit. When it comes to building a habit, feedback is often delayed. It\'s easy to taste an ingredient or to watch bread rise in the oven. But it can be difficult to visualize the progress you are making with your habits. Perhaps you\'ve been running for a month, but you still don\'t see a change in your body. Or maybe you managed to meditate for 16 straight days, but you still feel stressed and anxious at work.\r\n\r\nHabit formation is a long race. It often takes time for the desired results to appear. And while you are waiting for the long-term rewards of your efforts to accumulate, you need a reason to stick with it in the short-term. You need some immediate feedback that shows you are on the right path.\r\n\r\nAnd this is where a habit tracker can help.', 'Victor Magtanggol', 'thumbnail_1652712052.png', 'Real Estate', '2022-06-01'),
('This is a nice wallpaper', 'Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.

She spent the next 25 years working tirelessly for UNICEF, the arm of the United Nations that provides food and healthcare to children in war-torn countries.

He came to teach philosophy at a university a few hours northeast of Tokyo, in a city called Sendai.\r\n\r\nTo deepen his understanding of Japanese culture, Herrigel began training in Kyudo, the Japanese martial art of archery. He was taught by a legendary archer named Awa Kenzo. Kenzo was convinced that beginners should master the fundamentals of archery before attempting to shoot at a real target, and he took this method to the extreme. For the first four years of his training, Herrigel was only allowed to shoot at a roll of straw just seven feet away.\r\n\r\nWhen Herrigel complained of the incredibly slow pace, his teacher replied “The way to the goal is not to be measured! Of what importance are weeks, months, years?”\r\n\r\nWhen he was finally permitted to shoot at more distant targets, Herrigel’s performance was dismal. The arrows flew off course and he became more discouraged with each wayward shot. During a particularly humbling session, Herrigel stated that his problem must be poor aim.\r\n\r\nKenzo, however, looked at his student and replied that it was not whether one aimed, but how one approached the task that determined the outcome. Frustrated with this reply, Herrigel blurted out, “Then you ought to be able to hit it blindfolded.”\r\n\r\nKenzo paused for a moment and then said, “Come to see me this evening.”', 'James Clear', 'thumbnail_1652676142.png', 'Medicine', '2022-05-18');
