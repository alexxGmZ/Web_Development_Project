This is the uploaded_files directory:

This directory has 2 folders:
* memes_posted
* profile_pics

If these two folders are not shown, it's because it was included inside the .gitignore
and are empty.

It is to avoid the bloating of the repository by storing too much images. So you need to
create these folders locally in your machine.
